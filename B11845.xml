            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any are the miseries that are common to all mankinde, as the dangers wherto this life is subiect, and the vnpleasaunt sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of sorrow, sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, wants, troubles, and such other grievaunces, wherewith our life is sowred, doe plainely teach vs.
<pb facs="tcp:176702:4"/> There were amongst the Heathen that in consideration hereof vsed to weep, when their friendes were borne, and to reioice, when they died: by this custome acknow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledging, that the birth is an entrance into sorrow &amp; the vale of miserie, from which by death they were deliuered. Well wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<note place="margin">De civitate Dei lib. 21: cap: 14▪</note> Saint Augustine, that <hi>this whole life, is but a punishment.</hi> And the Sonne of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach notably describeth and setteth out before our eies, the misery that belongeth to this life. <hi>Great travell is created for all</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccle: 40: 1▪</note>
               <hi>men</hi> (saith hee) <hi>and a heavy yoke vpon the sonnes of Adam, from the day they goe out of their mothers wombe, till the day they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the mother of all things.</hi> Then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee sheweth how diuersly men are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and that this estate of life, befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth euen to him that sitteth vpon the throne, aswell as to the poore, that lieth in ashes, so that none can claime in▪ this, any priviledge or prerogatiue.</p>
            <p>And as all men haue their part of these common annoyances; so the godly haue
<pb facs="tcp:176702:4"/> besids these, their peculiar vexatiōs, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of sinne that is too rife in our selues and others; whereby we are grieved to see Gods glory defaced, his name prophaned, his word reiected, our most holy professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on slaundered, and our selues drawen of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times vnto sinne, against which wee striue, and shoulde striue euen vnto death.</p>
            <p>Many also are the comfortes that God affordeth vs his children, that we shoulde not in this place of our painefull pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, bee altogither oppressed with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and griefe, and overcome with care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cogitations. Such comfortes are the company of our friendes and such as wee delight in▪ the vse of Gods good creatures to supply all our wantes, and such other helpes as hee blesseth vs withall. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them all, there is not any like vnto that consolation, which we finde in resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to our good God, and making our moane to him, who is a Father, to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse, a husbande, to the widdowe, a
<pb facs="tcp:176702:5"/> helpe, to the helplesse, and a strong towre, to the distressed, comfort, to the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, to the sicke, medicine.</p>
            <p>Now wee cannot come vnto him, but by faith, nor speake vnto him, as suters to be deliuered from the evil, we feare, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with the good graces, that wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, but by praier: which is a deuoute lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp not of the hands only, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the hart, vnto the God of all grace, the founetaine of all goodnes. So that the necessitie of praier hereby appeareth, and that wee haue continuall occasions that may force vs to make our requestes to God.</p>
            <p>And least the burden of our sins should presse vs down to heauily, or we through our corruption or ignorance, should pray for other thinges, or in other sorte, then we ought: our Sauiour Christ hath set vs down a forme or patterne which we must follow, wherein wee may learne, as with boldnesse to come before the throne of grace, nothing doubting, but that our
<pb facs="tcp:176702:5"/> heavenly Father, will heare the sighes and groanes of vs his children: so also, how to frame our praiers in such sort, as that wee may be hard, and our requests granted, as in this little treatise I trust it will appeare. For though our heauenly Master promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that we shall finde, if we seeke, haue, if we aske, and the dore shalbee opened, if we knocke: yet we know that Saint Iames telleth some, that they <hi>aske, and haue not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iac: 4: 3:</note>
               <hi>because they aske amisse, that they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow or consume it on their lusts.</hi> Therfore it behoueth vs to pray with feeling of our wants, that we may pray fervently, and to follow the godly advice of Saint Iames in another place, who will haue vs to <hi>aske in</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iacob 1: 6:</note>
               <hi>faith,</hi> or faithfully, and without doubting. Nowe to come with such confidence it<note place="margin">1: Tim: 2. 8:</note> much availeth, that wee not only <hi>lift vp pure handes,</hi> in testimony of an vprighte conscience, as Saint Paule admonisheth<note place="margin">2: Tim: 2: 22</note> vs: but also that we <hi>cal vpon the Lord with a pure heart,</hi> as the same Apostle elswhere adviseth vs. For <hi>let every one that calleth</hi>
               <note place="margin">vers: 19:</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:176702:6"/>
               <hi>on the name of Christ, depart</hi> from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, everie one I say that professeth Christ Iesus, much more then such as seeke for his helpe, in their praiers. These and such like cautions or admonitions, are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for them that seeke and sue vnto that most mighty God, who punisheth sinne, and hateth wickednes, least that with idle words we beat the aire, and haue our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er turned into sinne.</p>
            <p>To this end therefore especially in this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle treatise vpon the Lords praier, haue I bent my selfe, &amp; directed my course, that I might instruct the ignorant, not onely what to aske, nor whereof they stand in neede; (though that be not altogither neg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lected) for our owne wantes, (if we haue any right feeling of our owne estate) wilbe a good schole▪ master to teach vs that les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: but especially, howe we should frame and prepare our selues, in these our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to come before our heavenlie Father; and what manner of men we ought to be, that beg such things at the hande of God.
<pb facs="tcp:176702:6"/> So that in this glasse we may see, not only what, or how to aske &amp; pray, but also how to liue, and by what rule wee must direct our conversation. Yea magistrates and pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vat persons, princes &amp; subiects, pastours, and their flocke, and al others whatsoever, may hereby be put in mind of some peece of duty; and that they cannot pray hartely and earnestly for that, which themselues by such meanes as God affoordeth do not also striue to advaunce and maintaine. For how absurd a thing is it, that wee say with our lippes, <hi>Hallowed be thy name, thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come, thy will be done:</hi> and yet God ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving given vnto vs many good meanes, to glorifie him, and set forth his praise, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaunce his kingdome, &amp; bring men vnto some reasonable obedience vnto his holie wil: we never set our hand to that plough, or apply our selues vnto that service, or at the least, we doe it to coldly, &amp; to seldōe? Is not this to aske, that we care not for, &amp; to pray for that we mind not, and to make a shewe to desire that we loue not? Is not
<pb facs="tcp:176702:7"/> this to dissemble with God, as if we were carefull of the things, that litle or nothing trouble vs?</p>
            <p>This and such like faultes wee may find with our selues, which also we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>forme, vnlesse we will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ast of Gods heavy wrath: and we may in some good measure learne to amēd thē, if we carefully regard, even those rules of life, which out of this form of praier we should gather, as to the godly reader I trust it will appeare.</p>
            <p>Now this treatise haue I thought good to present vnto your worship as to one vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to whome I confesse my selfe many waies indebted, and by divers bondes of curtesie very much bound: And that the rather, because amonge many losses of friendes, much sickenes and want of health, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other crosses and griefes, whereof for some yeares you haue had no small porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I doubt not but your chiefest, your qui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:176702:7"/> tender loue pitieth his, and keepeth even their very teares in his botle, and heereth their cries in the needeful time of trouble. Take I pray you in good parte, this simple token of my vnfeaned good will. Regarde it not according to the woorth thereof in price, but thinke what profit it may bring to a Christian. And as often as you call vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon our heavenly Father (which no doubt you doe verie often) thinke what manner of men we ought to be, that dare approch before him, and come into his presence, and how we should frame our selues so to intreat him, that hee may heare vs in this vale of misery, and comforte vs in all our griefs even vntill he bring vs to that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py place of endlesse ioy and perfect felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: which the Lord God in mercy giue to you, and al them that vnfeanedly loue the Lord Iesus Christ: Amen.</p>

               <hi>the day of our resurrection, hee that made you shall mistake you, and shutte you out, when you runne to en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ioy the rewards and promises?</hi> I suppose there was never more change of fashions then in these our daies, whereby we bewray our vanitye vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, make our selues a by word vnto the world, cast away from vs that modest apparrel that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beseemeth Christians, proclaime vnto all that we wil not professe the feare of the Lord, and ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny waies provoke Gods wrath: And yet when we come to entreat our God we dare cal him <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther,</hi> whose holines and incorruption wee are so farre from following, that we, we I say, that pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fesse more zeale then others, most willingly frāe our selues to the fonde fashion of lewde persons. And to the greater heaping vp of Gods wrath to our condemnation without al excuse, we cōtinue in this excesse of pride, in these daies, when God pincheth vs with hunger, and visiteth our sinnes with a sharp rodde of sicknes in many places, and threatneth also destruction by warres. Which signes of Gods wrath because they are not of force to abate our foolish pride, but that wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine secure &amp; senceles in that &amp; other transgres<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sions, it maketh the godly not without cause to feare, least a heavier iudgmente hange over our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:176702:15"/> heades, which vnlesse we speedely repent, we are not like to escape. Therefore as wee call him <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> so let vs seeke to resēble him in al holines, modesty, meekenes, lowlines, sobriety, patience &amp; other Christian vertues: that our own conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may testifie with vs, that as we call him <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> so we earnestly striue to frame our selues to bee like vnto him.

            <p>But it is not the meaning of our Sauiour Christ in teaching vs to praye <hi>our Father,</hi> to condemne as vnlawfull our prayers that are

            <p>Lastly I note in this word, that we are direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our petitions vnto God, because we, wee I<note place="margin">We though sinners are to pray to God.</note> say sinfull wretches, are willed in our owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons not to be afraide to come before him.

We, no they being conpared vnto him, even in their greatest strength, are weaker then water, viler then worms.

            <p>And thus much concerning the preface of the Lords praier, wherein wee haue comfort and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. Comfort, in that we are commaunded to call him Father, and that our Father; and such a Father as is in heaven, that is in the place of might and glorie, whether we his children haue promise that we shall come.

And to whō we must make our praiers wee are heere plainely taught, nāely to God only whose loue to vs ward, passeth the loue of any Father to his childe, who because hee is in heaven, wee therefore must lifte vp our harts thither, and haue our affections heavenly.</p>
            <p>The second part of the Lordes praier contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth sixe petitions, wherof the first three teach vs to aske such thinges as chiefely doe concerne Gods glory: the three last petitions, do especially concerne our selues, and those thinges that belong not to our life onely, or our body; but also to our soule, and happie or godlie life.</p>
            <p>The first petition is, <hi>Hallowed be thy name.</hi> By<note place="margin">Gods name</note> the <hi>name</hi> of God is heere mente whatsoever wee knowe of God. For as by their names we knowe all the creatures, in so much as when we heare a thing named, we knowe what is mente thereby: So those attributes or properties whereby wee set forth Gods nature, whether of goodnes, or of greatenesse, or whatsoever else, are his name. And so the effecte of this praier is, that what thinge soever it is, that wee heare, learne, or knowe of GOD, we frame our selues with all reverence to receiue it, and to make such vse thereof, as may bee most to GODS glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>

            <p>The order it selfe of these petitions, wherein the thinges that belong vnto God (as it is meete and right) are preferred before those things that concerne our selues: teacheth vs what reckoning<note place="margin">Gods glory to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</note> wee oughtt to make of al thinges in this world. For if we be truely sanctified to the Lorde, and haue such care of Gods glorie as wee ought to haue, we will so greatly loue it, and so wholy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it, that no profit, pleasure, ioy, loue, hope, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, safety, or life it selfe, shall more delight vs, then the doing of that whereby God may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.

            <p>And amongest the thinges which especiallye concerne GOD, wee must beginne with the sanctifieng of his name, that is, his glory. First because all our actions, yea our very wordes and thoughts, ought alwaies to bee directed to Gods glorie, as God willing shall after appeare. Then also because the sanctifieng of Gods name is so needful, that vntil an earnest desire therof be set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led &amp; planted in our harts, nothing that wee doe, can be good or acceptable vnto God. If we pray, we must in the requests that we make, have a spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciall eie to Gods glory. If we giue almes, if wee mourne &amp; weepe for our sins, if we be doing good to others, in al things our chiefe regard ought to be this, that god may be glorified. For this cause must the light of religiō or professiō, shine (by our holy &amp; Christian conversation) before men, <hi>that</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat: 5: 16:</note>
               <hi>they may see our good workes, and glorifie our Father
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:176702:29"/> which is in heaven.</hi> For this cause our Saviour Christ teacheth vs in this praier to lay this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation▪ ro set before our eies first the <hi>Hallowing of Gods name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Gods name is of it selfe holy, in so much as whatsoever we consider in God, whether his wisedome, or his goodnes, or his greatnes, or his iustice, we cannot find any thing but holinesse in him: so that we must vnfainedly confesse, that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly and reverent is his name:</hi> why are we thē taught<note place="margin">Psal: 111: 9</note> to pray, that his name which is never other then holy, neither yet can be, should be hallowed? We doe not make request that it may bee holy in it<note place="margin">Howe wee pray for sanctifying Gods name</note> selfe, but that we his creatures may sanctify the same, both in our hart &amp; affectiō, louing his word, cōforting our selues in his promises, fearing his greatnes, trembling at his iudgmēts, reioycing in his mercies: &amp; also in al our life &amp; cōversatiō, by serving him in holines and righteousnes, such as shal be through Christ acceptable vnto him.</p>
            <p>And great reasōs there are that may not moue<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reasons why wee should san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie Gods name.</note> vs onely, but that should even force and driue vs, earnestly to seeke and sue for this: first the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of our Saviour Christ, which to a Christian mā or womā should be of such waight, that it should more presse vs, then any profite or pleasure. Then also that duty which of every one of vs is required, in respect whereof it is, that the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:176702:29"/> sweete singer of Israel, doth thus stirre vs vp to that office: <hi>Giue vnto the Lord ye sons of the mighty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal 29: 1:</note>
               <hi>giue vnto the Lord glory &amp; strength. Giue vnto the Lord glorie (due) vnto his name, worshippe the Lord in the glorious sanctuary.</hi> And again, <hi>Giue vnto the</hi>

               <hi>Lord ye families of the people: giue vnto the Lord glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry &amp; power Giue vnto the Lord the glory of his nāe.</hi> Wherby we see, how earnestly the spirit of God by the prophet, requireth this duty to bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Thirdly the exāple of the creatures, should be a great inducement to moue vs therto. For in that they keepe their course, &amp; serve to such vse as God created thē vnto, therby they cōfesse the wis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dōe of God, &amp; acknowledg him to be holy in al his works. Therfore so often as we see spring time, sūmer, harvest, &amp; winter, night &amp; day, light &amp; dark<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, the profitable order also of the sun, the moone &amp; the stars, the ornamēts of the heavēs, &amp; the bew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty &amp; comely decking of the earth: wee haue great cause to praise the maker of these things, &amp; to hal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>low his name, who hath created these to our vse; &amp; to cōfesse his wisdōe &amp; power, who hath set thē in so comlie an order; &amp; his mercy to vs ward, for whose sakes especially these thinges were made. And the other creaturs, because we haue so good vse of thē should move vs to praise gods name for thē &amp; by their exāple in that they obey gods order, &amp; so in some sort yeld to Gods wisdōe &amp; goodnes
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:176702:30"/> due honour, oughte to prouoke vs to glorifie his name: so is the example of the Angels, those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent creatures worthy to be followed, whose song is this in the praise of God, <hi>Holy, holy, holie, Lord God of hosts.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa: 6: 3:</note>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, if we looke vpon Gods benefits to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs many waies, what cause haue wee to praise him? He hath created vs of nothing, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own Image, most excellēt creatures. He hath giuen to vs comelines of body, reason, &amp; vnderstanding. He made all things to serue vs, &amp; vs to set forth his praise. Haue we not then great cause to hallow his name? But yet his goodnesse towards vs is greater. Whē we through our cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruption, had marred that which he made good; he mended that which was amisse, reformed that was faulty, renued that was old, and sanctified in some measure, that which was vnholy; <hi>O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal: 107: 7:</note>
               <hi>that men woulde confesse before the Lorde his loving kindnesse, and declare the wonders that hee doeth for the sonnes of men! For what can wee ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal: 116: 12:</note>
               <hi>vnto the Lord, for all his benefites towardes vs? Offer vnto God praise, and pay thy vowes to the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal: 50: 14: 23.</note>
               <hi>most high. For hee that offereth praise doth glorifie him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as these &amp; many other reasons may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce vs to confesse, that wee must sanctifie Gods name, vnlesse we will reiect Christes commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:176702:30"/> neglect our dutie, bee more slacke and dull heerein then the senselesse creatures, &amp; more vnthankfull then beseemeth Christians: so there is nothing that should rather allure vs, seriously to seeke, and earnestly to pray, that Gods name may be hallowed, then the great lets &amp; hinderāce that we haue, whereby we are made more slacke and vnwilling to doe the same. For of our own nature wee are prone and inclining to euill, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to transgresse, delighting in pleasures &amp; flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lustes, easily taken with the sweete baites of sinne; vnwise and vnwary in matters belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the saluation of our soules. Our harts are most ready to conceiue and thinke, our mouthes to speake and vtter, and all the members of our body to do the thinges that prophane the name of God.</p>
            <p>Then if wee haue regarde vnto the thinges that are without; good Lorde what incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente haue these our vngodly motions, what prouocations vnto sinne doe wee feele, what al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurementes vnto wickednesse, what discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente from good? The woorlde sometime frowneth, and sometime fawneth, but alwaie deceaueth. The deuill stirreth vppe our owne corruption, and bloweth as it were the fire of impiety that is within vs, to make vs worse then naughte. Our friendes vnder a colour of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:176702:31"/> worldly frendship, by worldly persuasion abuse vs; our foes by threatnings and brags seeke to terrifie vs. So that sometimes by faire meanes sometime by foul alwaies by false, we are drawn backe, if at any time we would sincerely sanctify the name of God. Sith therefore it is so hard a thing for vs being so many waies letted to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this duty: we see, good cause there is, why our Saviour Christ in this form of praier which he setteth before vs, should teach vs to begge as a thing most necessary, that Gods <hi>name may bee Hallowed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why are wee taught to aske this of our<note place="margin">God onely worketh in vs to sancti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fie him.</note> Father in heaven? Because he only can giue it; he onely by his holy spirit can worke it in vs; whoe also of his abundant grace and mercy, shall and will frame them to it, that earnestly seeke it. We can saie <hi>Our Father vvhich arte in heaven.</hi> Wee may speake the wordes of praier: But vnlesse we haue the spirit of praier, which God onely giveth vs from aboue; although we number our praiers vpon our beades or knottes, or score them vp as vpon a Bakers score, to call God to reckenning for them: yet such praiers are turned but into sinne, so farre are wee from <hi>Hallovving Gods name</hi> by them. If wee haue in our mouth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, <hi>GOD bee praised,</hi> or, <hi>The LORD bee thanked,</hi> and sing manie songes of thankes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:176702:31"/> vnto the almightie: yet if GOD doe not inwardly touch vs, with sweete and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble feeling of his graces toward vs, that wee may <hi>singe and make melody to the Lord in our harts</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph: 5: 19:</note> our mouth or lippes are but as a sounding brasse or tinkling Cimball, and yeeld not to GOD, the honour due vnto him. Wee may bestowe our goods vpon the poore, or doe other externall woorkes of charitie: but GOD in such thinges is not glorified, vnlesse wee haue regard to the end of the lawe, which is, that loue proceede <hi>out</hi>

And for all our woorkes of obedience to Gods law, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men esteeme of them: yet are they not either acceptable services to God, or such as can sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his name worthely, vnles our harts be (first)<note place="margin">Act: 15: 9:</note>

Therfore howsoever in our outward appearaūce, we may seem to haue a kind of resemblaūce &amp; imitation, of such godlie &amp; Christian deedes: yet because his name is not truely and sincerely hallowed, vnlesse wee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the Apostle Saint Peters councel, to <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now to shew in few words, what it is that we<note place="margin">What wee aske in this petition.</note> sue for in this petition: wee pray that God will giue vs such meanes to learne, and such grace to knowe Gods will, that we also may be obedient vnto the same, and so glorifie him in wordes, in works, and euery way, yea euen in our sufferings also. But because that euery one of vs doeth owe a twofolde duty vnto God; the one generall, by that our generall vocation, whereby we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Christians; the other particular, in respect of some more priuate place, or peculiar function, whereunto we are appointed; it shall not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse to consider, how we may both in the one, &amp; other, vse the best meanes to hallow the name of God.</p>

All which beeing considered, wee may learne thereby, earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to call vpon our good GOD, that it may please him so to lighten our ignoraunce, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease our loue to God, and our charitie to our neighbour, and to strengthen our faith, that wee in, and by this, may alwaies Sanctifie his holie name.</p>
            <p>And as we haue very often wantes and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities in our good and godlie cogitations, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:176702:40"/> in our deedes also: so sometime they are ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with very sinnefull and corrupte affections.<note place="margin">Worldlie respectes in seruing of God</note> As when wee will seeme to serue God, yet not for Gods cause, but to please men, to seeke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, to gaine either goods or friendes, or for feare of losse. And to this end, and in this regarde haue many things bin done vnder the name of y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> works of charity, whereby rather idle loyterers are mainetained, then the poore and needy relee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Yea and such is our corruption, that if our works of duty towards our neighbour, haue not altogither such considerations: yet wee shall finde a coldnesse, or vnwillingnesse, or some negligence in perfourming of the same. Al which stumbling blockes and impedimentes, wee are heere taught to pray that they may be taken out of the way, that wee in hallowing of Gods name may haue a free course and passage: that these worldly respects being reformed, our coldnesse somwhat kindled, and al our wants supplied, we may truly set forth the praise of Gods name.</p>
            <p>And because we are here commanded to aske that, the contrary whereof hath a flat prohibition in the third commandement, there is a great co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence betweene the one and the other, in so much as we may well expound this petition, by that commaundement. Therefore that we take not in vaine GODS holy name, it is verie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:176702:41"/> that in all, even our best workes, we ende<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vour<note place="margin">Holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons:</note> to call for a sincere affection to do the same.

If wee talke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, wee must doe it with greate reverence. What haue the lippes polluted with wicked woords, or the mouth defiled with excesse of drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or that tong that is stained with vntruthes and shames, what haue these to do with the word of God?

Therefore in steed of Macheuill his prophane conceites, &amp; the perilous policies of worldly men, who make for the most part religion, to waite as a handmaide, vpon the earthly wisdome of men, which is not descended from aboue: But leauing I say such patterns, which we are but too ready to followe; let this petitiō <hi>hallowed be thy name,</hi> be as a glasse before our eies, according to the which, wee will addresse our whole life and conuersation.

That euerie one of vs may bee diligent in our calling, not abusing it to doe wronge or violence, to deceiue or defrawde, by any false waightes, faulse measures, faulse labour or worke. To bee shorte, it were very good wee woulde take nothing in hand, but that lifting vp our heartes vnto God, saying with a deuoute minde, <hi>Hallovved hee thy name,</hi> wee woulde consecrate our worke to GODS glorie. But heere Princes whose consciences are chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye charged for good refourmation both in their CHURCH and Common wealth, maye doe well to set before them the examples of the godly kings of Iuda in the things wherein they are commended by the spirite of God.

And when Iehosaphat came to bee king, hee did these<note place="margin">2: Cro. 17: 6</note> thinges yet more. But Ezechiah went farther then they, for besides such abuses in religion as they reformed, he also brake the brasen Serpent<note place="margin">2: King: 18: 4</note> that Moses had made, because the people bur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And here, oh that it pleased God to giue mee a fountaine of teares, to lament and bewaile the misery of these our daies, wherein the sunne of Gods truth shineth most cleerely, and the star of his word appeareth most beautifully, but because we are blinded with the loue of ease, or gaine, or<note place="margin">Negligēce in our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery.</note> some such corruption, the eie of our conscience be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing put out, wee see not that the neglect of our

Many of vs study to serue and glorifie men, that they may glorifie vs againe, and serue our turne; with adding charge to charge, liuing to liuing, euen sinne to sinne. Some waite in the court and great mens houses gaping and suing still for more, although they haue no great care to discharge the charge that is already committed vnto them. Some loyter in the country, with too little regarde of doing their duty. Alas how is the people by this means nussed in ignorance, confirmed in errour and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiō, made a pray to euery runnagate Priest that commeth from Rome or Rhemes, to draw them to rebellion against God and man, wherby God doth want his honour, and princes their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience?

            </p>
            <p>The two petitions nexte following, are but as it were the meanes to performe the former. For if Gods kingdome bee established, and his wil obey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, then is his name hallowed. But the first of these two, is this, <hi>Thy kingdōe come.</hi> For in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kingdomes, there is first a kingdome and state established, then follow the laws &amp; decrees which in the same must be obeyed: even so in giving due honour to our heavenly Father, we must first ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge▪ his thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

O God<note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this petitiō</note> wee acknowledge and confesse that thou rulest &amp; raignest in heaven and earth; to thee al creatures stoop and thee they serve; thou commaundest the sea, and it obeieth; the windes and waues, and they are calme and quiet; thou settest vp princes, and mightie ones, thou makest of the meanest; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine thou pluckest them downe, and dauntest their stout stomackes, with thine angry counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce; thou turnest also their hartes, as see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth good to thy divine wisdome.

            <p>Now the kingdome of God is taken after two sorts. For it signifieth either the kingdome of <hi>grace▪</hi> or the kingdome of <hi>glorie,</hi> both which wee craue in this petition.

But because wee must clime vp to this throne of grace by certaine steppes: there are heere sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie thinges sued for. As first that the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:176702:47"/> Lord will worke in vs, a reverence to the rod, or<note place="margin">A reverēce to his word</note> scepter of his power, which is his word, therby to subdue our rebellious affections, &amp; to tame our vngodly lusts: so that whensoever we shall begin to wander after our owne waies, we by this scep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter may be reclaimed.</p>
            <p>But Gods kingdome is not as yet established amongst vs, as soone as we are content to heare him speake; but it is farder required of vs, that by Gods good grace our evill affections beeing cut of, this immortall seede, this <hi>Word of truth,</hi> may<note place="margin">1: Pet: 1▪ 23: Iam: 1▪ 18:</note> be planted and grafted into the hart of vs, &amp; there grow fruitful and yeld good increase, of holy and Christian conversation.

Therefore wee praie, that righteousnesse and peace, and ioye in the holie Ghost, may so bee rooted and settled in our heartes, that we may with a Christian courage, either vse these externall thinges as meates, mariage, and such like, which some men in the abundance of their impiety, haue accounted prophane at sometime, or for some men: or refuse the bondage of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies as may most serue for GODS glory, and other mens good. And thus wee see howe GOD raigneth in our heartes as king, both in framing our harts to an inward and sincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and also in governing our consciences in the good vse of all his creatures.</p>
            <p>But this petition <hi>Thy kingdome come,</hi> may not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:176702:49"/> only bee vnderstoode of that particular power, which wee wish that God woulde shew in euery one of vs (whereof hitherto I haue spoken:) but also more generally that God woulde shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to beare rule in his church, that his worde might be obeied, his truth maintained, his people preserued, his enemies scattered, that wee all his servants, being <hi>delivered out of the hands of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, should serue him without feare; in holines &amp;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk: 1: 74: 75:</note>
               <hi>righteousnesse before him, all the daies of our life.</hi> To be short we pray that in this church of God, or among the people of God, the traditions of men being reiected, vnwritten verities (so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but in truth falsities) abolished, &amp; all decrees besides the holy and sacred Scriptures, trodden vnder foot; the lighte of Gods lawes may only shine vnto vs, and the scepter of his word be only obeied among vs.</p>
            <p>And thus we see what is the summe and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of that we aske here, <hi>Thy kingdome come:</hi> namely that as in the former petition we craued that God mighte haue honour due to his name, which by sundrie meanes is perfourmed, so in this wee intreate him also, that hee may haue holie obedience, that his worde may haue such effect, as that it beeing planted in vs, and sinne rooted out, we may greatly increase in al god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse. And further that the peace of God so rule
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:176702:49"/> in our consciences, that wee neuer stand in any feare, lawfully to vse Gods good creatures; that God only, and not superstitious conceites, may rule in our heartes, and bear the sway. And lastly that our heauenly Father, will so guide his whole Church after the lighte of his worde, and so defende it of his greate goodnesse; that it neither bee broughte into the bondage of the kingdome of darknes, by errour; neither yet be made a pray to the wicked, by their vngodly and cruell practises.</p>
            <p>Now how greate is the necessity of this prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as all men may easily see, that enter into any due consideration, of the miserable estate of this wicked worlde: so the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dly cannot but confesse it, and therefore often and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie seeke and sue, that GODS kingdome may come. For alas when wee take a view of the practises of the worlde, wee may easilie see, that a greate number of them, who haue in their mouthes not seldome these wordes, <hi>Thy kingdome come,</hi> yet doe not indeuour by such good and greate meanes as God hath giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, to set foorth the same; euen they who shoulde bee the great labourers to set it vp, and after some sort pillers in this worlde to vpholde it, by that greate authoritye and power that God hath called them vnto; doe nothing so much
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:176702:50"/> as seeke to set vp themselues, and advaunce their posterity, setting forward Gods kingdome in the meane time, but by graines and scruples. Doth not religion many times serue pollicy, and the gospell of God, attend vpon the pleasure of men? Profit, delight, ease, favour of men, estimation and credit in the world, and such like thinges, are chiefely thought vpon, but GODS king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, no further then it may stande with these. Seeing therefore there is so little hope, that great ones will abandon their owne affections, to inlarge GODS kingdome: wee haue good cause to aske this of him, who can rule and guid the harts of all men, &amp; vse the meanes of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to serve his turne.</p>
            <p>Againe the gospell hath nowe aboue forty<note place="margin">Reformatiō</note> yeares beene preached in this our land. Shall we aske what reformation in religion, is now more then at the first? Some thinges were then tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, if not offensuie to many of the godly, yet needles and vnfruitfull, to speake the least evil of them. Are they not still lefte and suffered, yea so, that sometimes godlie men, are by them brought in bondage and subiectiō, vnto Atheists and vngodly persons, and enemies vnto religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who seeke by them to take advantage against faithfull ministers that reprooue their sinne, or discover their disobedience? If Cōmon welthes
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:176702:50"/> haue their parlamentes, for taking order for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, and to reforme such thinges as by experience are found to bee evill: If men of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, will revewe the worke that they haue made, and correct that is faultie: howe commeth it to passe, that in the Church there is so little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending of that which is amisse▪ why shoulde we abounde in knowledge more and more, as a little before is shewed, if not to practise it? And howe can wee bee saide to practise it, if wee seeke not to fashion our selues in all thinges according to it▪ But you will say the lawes of men neede mending, because they are vnperfect: As for Gods lawe it is such as may not be altered, and so pure, that it cannot bee bettered. This is most true. Yet if we haue sometimes borne with some thinges not in materiall pointes, but in thinges of lesse moment, least at the first we should offend the weake (for then that was alleaged) it were in my iudgment good for vs to take heede, that by to much forbearing, wee make them not obstinat and stubborne, that weere but weake, and so by meanes to encrease their sinne: or grieve and offend in such thinges the most godly. God hath given vnto this realme many blessinges, greate lighte and knowledge of the gospell of salvation, and a most peaceable profession of the same, by the meanes of our most blessed sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:176702:51"/> oh that it mighte please his Fatherlie kindenesse, so to worke yet more in her hearte, that nothing mighte bee lefte in Gods seruice, seemeth it neuer so little, but that which should set forwarde Gods kingdome. God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse I seeke not vndutifully any innovation or alteration, I thanke God heartely for that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere trueth that wee haue, but I wish to all Christian Princes, but especiallie to such as God hath set ouer this our lande, to bee ielous with great ielousie for the Lorde God of hostes, and with a feruent zeale, to seeke the increase of Gods kingdome, and the taking away of any thing that may hinder it: that so growing neerer and neerer to the perfection of this kingdom, we may with greater comfort say alwaies, <hi>Thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there are also among vs, such as are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to this kingdome of God, which he by his Sonne Christ Iesus doth administer &amp; gouern;<note place="margin">Recusante.</note> who will haue a Pope to rule ouer them, a man whose office, is derogatory vnto Christ, whose doctrines are contrary to the worde of God, and whose doinges, are like the doinges for the most parte, of prophane men. And as they vse all meanes they can, to ouerthrowe this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, (for they seeke all waies, either to pull downe the scepter of this kingdome which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:176702:51"/> is the worde, or to keepe it hidden in the case, that it bee not seene) so are many of them in our North countries perilous subiectes to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of men. And though they will promise much, and professe greate fidelitie, and protest confidently of their loyaltie: yet I would wish that you whome GOD hath made greate, to oppose your selues against the greatest of his aduersaries, either abroade, or at home, should not trust them. For why their neighboures, finde them at home stubborne enough, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry insolent vpon euery occasion. These dare (so I had almost saide rebelliouslie, they dare I say) so boldlie, withstande the trueth, that there are with vs some housholdes, and diuerse chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that either will not, or dare not come to the Church. Yea and they dare sometime to assemble in great companies, which how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a thinge it may bee in pollicie, let wise politickes iudge. For my part I know it to bee little good Diuinity, to suffer the wedding din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be so vnfurnished; they should bee compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to come in.</p>
            <p>You will perchaunce reply, that there is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie enoughe by Commission to conuente them. But who shall bring them in, especially in these wilde countries? They are many, they are bolde, and some of them godlesse enough,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:176702:52"/> and such whose state cannot be meaner then it is, and so fit for any change. And therfore it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful such were looked vnto. I haue heard also that there are of them, who though they will not in any wise submit themselues to the kingdome of God: yet they finde meanes to exempt thēselues, from the danger of the lawes of men. They are so well frended, that they can, nay they dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themselues to be bounde, to answere before them, whose name and authority should be feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to such wilfull withdrawers of their loyalty &amp; obedience: because that as through their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes they may, so in respect of their duty, they must haue a vigilant eie ouer such starting subiectes. But what is the cause of this their boldnes? Is it because they hope to finde more fauour there where they are not knowne, then amonge them that are somewhat acquainted with their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour? Indeed they sometime finde too much. Or is it rather because they trust neuer to bee called before them to make answere? It may very well be. For who wll imagine, that they who are trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bled with so many matters of great importance, may haue leasure to think of recusants two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles from them▪ But if the most honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble table would indeed call such, and let thē taste somewhat of law, if they would not dutifully cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themselues, they might worke a terror in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:176702:52"/> the hartes of very many that are now obstinate. But if vnder that colour, they be free frō al law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full punishment; at home, because they will not answer; aboue, because they are neuer called; cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider I pray you, how repugnaunt that course is to the laws, and how dangerous to the state. If any man may liue in a common wealth, and not be a subiect in the same, but despise the laws, and contemne authority, what may grow thereof it is not hard to coniecture. These thinges make gods deere children, seeing such faintnes in some to maintaine Gods cause; in other, such boldnes, euen in these daies of the gospell, to impugne the truth, and despise authority; the consideration I say of such thinges, causeth them in griefe, with groanes to cry, and in anguish of hart to say, <hi>Thy kingdome come.</hi> To be shorte, the aboundance of sinne, the slacknesse of punishment, the incourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bad, the oppressions of them that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not withstand, the excesse in pride, the monstrous shapes of men and women, in their head, and in their body, &amp; that when God calleth vs to mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and lamentation, these I say, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our grosse transgressions, wherewith wee defile our land, pollute our selues, procure Gods wrath, and prouoke his iudgementes against vs, giue vs iust cause earnestly to crie, <hi>Thy kingdome come.</hi>

O LORD GOD who in wisedome governest all thinges, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posest of thy creatures, as it seemeth good to thee according to thy vnspeakable knowledge, whose thoughtes are out of our reach, and thy waies past finding out: worke thine owne wil, performe in vs thy pleasure.

But our Saviour Christ correcteth that errour, teaching vs that howsoever wee finde our selues vnable to doe as we should; yet while we are vpō the earth, we must striue to be perfect. We must seeke to deny our owne will, that Gods will may be obeied. This should be our meditation night &amp; day.

            </p>
            <p>Heere then we learne to depend vppon Gods providence, and to rest vppon his goodnes: Not that▪ we should in the meane time liue idly, with out calling, or without care, buty walking in our vocation, (which also must be such as may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary &amp; profitable to y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> cōmō wealth) we follow
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:176702:70"/> not gaine too greedily, we doe not carke and care too mistrustfully, we doe not seeke to increase by our industry and labours vnlawfully, or vnthāk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ascribe that vnto the gifte of the creature, which wee receiue of the bountifull goodnes of the creatour. Wee heere praye that God will giue vs some such place in the common wealth, as that we may therin be profitable to our selues and others. Then also that God will giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to al our labours &amp; paines good successe. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that hee will increase our store in such sorte, that we may see and be forced to confesse, that the<note place="margin">Ioel: 2: 14:</note> Lorde <hi>hath lefte a blessing behinde him.</hi> And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that hee will giue power and vertue to these creatures, that they may bee profitable vnto our vse and turne to our good, as God willing after shall be said.</p>
            <p>And as in the beginning of this praier he taught vs to say, <hi>Our father,</hi> that we might think of that communion of Saintes, and fellowship that wee<note place="margin">Others wāt to be thought vpon</note> haue one with another, and frame our affections accordingly: so here he teacheth vs, not to thinke of our own wāts only, but also to pray for the sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ply of the wantes of others. And therefore hee willeth vs to say, <hi>Giue ƲS OƲR breade,</hi> and not giue <hi>Mee MY</hi> breade. For if we be the members of IESVS CHRIST, in whome wee are coupled and knit togither into
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:176702:70"/> one body, and by whose spirit we are vnited, and made of one minde: we can no more bee without feeling of our brethrens miseries, then our bodie can be without griefe, if our hand, or foote, or any other member of the same, bee pinched &amp; pained. The law it selfe that saith vnto vs▪ <hi>Thou shalt loue</hi>

               <hi>thy neighbour as thy selfe,</hi> giueth vs to vnderstand, that we should not be more vnmindfull of others, then of our selues. So that if wee knowe of any particular parson, that hath want of thinges ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for this life, we learne here to be mindful of such. And because wee are sure that there are many vnknowne vnto vs, that stande in neede of meate for their bellies, and cloathing for their backes▪ we are here admonished, to haue a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall care for all our brethren and sisters, and doe here intreat God, to giue to such as lacke neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary maintenance for this life.</p>
            <p>But when wee say <hi>Giue vs this day our dailie bread,</hi> doth Christ by this word (<hi>vs</hi>) meane onlie those who may truely and vndoubtedly, cal God their Father, as the words themselues seeme to import (for it seemeth by this praier, <hi>Our Father, Giue vs our bread,</hi> that we are taught to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of our brethren only) or els must wee also thinke of the miseries of them, that as▪ yet do not<note place="margin">We must pray for supply of al mens wāts.</note> call God their Father, no neither can they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they know him not?

Then also how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they seeme to bee vnto vs, yet the Lordes hand is not so tied, but that when he wil, be may draw them into his fold. For we know not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be goates, or wandring sheepe.

            </p>
            <p>It followeth giue vs <hi>This day</hi> our daily bread. Because the nature of man is in these bodily things too too earnest, nether can easily keep any measure in seeking the same; therfore our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Christ restraineth herein our greedy appetite, and tieth our desires to certaine lists and limits, y<seg rend="sup">•</seg> they wāder not to far out of the way.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:176702:76"/> the same.</p>
            <p>For the interpretation then of this petitiō, we must consider of the eight and ten commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the keeping whereof we are taught to praie.

But doe they better imploy the night? Not much For euen then also they haue their carding, dising, and such other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes, to spende their thrift, and to wast good time. I speake not against some of these things, as if I woulde condemne them as simplie euill. But in the least euill of them, it were to bee wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed that there were moderation vsed, and that wee woulde remember, that none of all these thinges, is a necessarie calling in a common wealth. And when any haue toiled themselues in these thinges daie and nighte, taking much more paines, then others haue done, that haue notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standing beene profitable to their country, then would I know of them, what comfort they haue in respect of all their labour, when they shoulde aske their meate at the hand of God, to say vnto him, <hi>Giue vs our bread?</hi> Howe haue they deserued it? Are these trauels such as God will accept of? No no, my dear brethrē: I am verely perswaded that among many great transgressions, wherby we haue prouoked the Lorde to anger, one of the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:176702:80"/> greatest that procured the late long and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous famine, not without other plagues of God also, is this common idle life, which a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>doe-nothings</hi> doe liue in these daies, as if they were borne but to goe vp and downe, take their pleasure, and cary their own cloathes.

            </p>
            <p>And thus I trust it appeareth, that wee may not iustly call it ours, vnles we come truly by it, or labour for it painfully.

And these labours, which are rather the worke of the hart, then of the hands, are far more painfull, then is the travel of the body. For when the labouring man hath done his day worke, he eateth his meat
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:176702:80"/> sweetly, and sleepeth soundly: Wheras they that sit in the highest places, feede many times with care and griefe, breake their sleep; and beat their braines, for others good. Are they not then well worthy, to haue a greater portion allowed for their maintenance? Yes verely. And I praye GOD that they and everie one of them, may so woorke in their places, that whatsoever it is that they haue, they may lawfully come by it, and take good paines for it, that when they say, Give vs <hi>our bread,</hi> their owne hart may not aunswere, thou carest more for thy profit, pleasure, ease, esti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mation, preferment, then for the doing of thy du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty to the good of others, therefore there is little or nothinge due to thee.

            <p>To speake therefore of the first of these two, which is in number the fifte petition, it is not a simple petitiō, as are the other, but it hath a kind of limitation, or as the Lawyers speake, rather a stipulation and promise annexed to the same, <hi>Forgiue vs, as vvee forgiue others.</hi> But let vs<note place="margin">Forgiuenes necessary:</note> first consider of the praier, which is, <hi>Forgiue vs our trespasses.</hi> Which thing howe necessary it is that we should craue, it will easilie appear, if wee haue anie regarde either to this life, or to the life to come.

And as God<note place="margin">Levit 26: Deuter: 28.</note> promiseth to blesse our store, our cattel, our fields our cities, our howses, the fruite of our bodie, and our selues also, if we serue and feare him: So on the contrary, he threatneth manie plagues to bee powred out against such as transgresse his laws, and breake his commandements.

            <p>But now the question wil bee whether we be sinners or not; or at the least whether our sinnes be so great and grieuous, that they must procure (vnlesse they be forgiuen) the fearefull displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God.

And not seldome we are like to seruauntes that knowe their Masters will, and doe it not, because of such draw-backes as we finde within our selues, which hinder vs in our course of holie obedience. And as we leaue vndone many good things, so that good also that we doe, is done for the most part so coldly &amp; neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, so vnwillingly and without such delight as we ought to haue in it, to such wrong endes, &amp; in such worldly respects, that if we haue any true feeling of our own affections, and a right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a good work, what it is, and how it must be perfected, wee shall finde that nothing can bee more cōfortable to vs, then that we may boldlie say, <hi>Forgiue vs our trespasses.</hi> Especially if wee adde to these considerations, a view of our sinnes which daily we doe commit, in thought worde &amp; deede, against God, against man, priuily and opē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, in iest, in earnest, in youth, in our age.

And if we seeke not this helpe, we shall vndoubtedly prooue to our great griefe, that the taste of sinne is too too bitter, and the end thereof shalbee vncomfortable. For wee cannot dwell with a more noysome neighbour, or receiue a<note place="margin">Sinne trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome:</note> worse guest then sinne is. If thou reiect her,

As for the wicked they betray all helps that reason offereth; their owne thoughtes are to them most cruell tormentours. If they looke vp to heaven, they tremble at Gods presence; if they behold the earth, they imagine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very grasse pile to bee a witnesse against them; When they consider of the creatures, they take them for their enemies, as if GOD, against whome they knowe and feele they haue sinned, had armed them to their destruction; they sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect all thinges; they feare all thinges; goodes, landes, wife, children, vnto them are vnpleasant.

            <p>And now it is time that we consider what we aske in this petition, and what we haue to learn out of the same. First it is not vnprofitable for vs to remember, to whom our Sauiour Christ giueth this patterne of praier. Saint Luke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth that <hi>one of his disciples saide vnto him, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>

               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it seemeth also by Saint Matthew that he taught this, his disciples being gathered about him. Yea there is none so perfect, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>neither hath beene (Christ only excepted) but that hee must, if hee will see God, say <hi>Forgiue vs our tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes.</hi> And in asking forgiuenes of sinnes, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse our selues to be sinners: which thing is good for vs to doe, as Dauid by his experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, who saith thus, <hi>When I helde my tongue</hi> (&amp;<note place="margin">Psal: 32: 3:</note> confessed not my faults) <hi>my bones consumed.

               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:176702:95"/>
               <hi>Lfrd:</hi> Vnto the Lord I say whom we haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and who can forgiue them, and will if wee aske earnestlie, for his sonne Christ his sake. But as for that Popish shrift, or confession in the ears of a Priest, I say thereof boldly with Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine:<note place="margin">Shrift or eare cōfes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: <hi>Con: l:</hi> 10: c: 2</note>
               <hi>What haue I to doe with men, that they shoulde heare my confession, as if they woulde heale all my infirmities? A curious sorte of men are they, to pry into another mans life; but slow and sloathfull to amende their owne.</hi> And here because the begging of forgiuenes of offences, imployeth a confession of the same, the Puritanes called Cathari (for it is a name fit for them that say they are perfect, not for such as only wish that things were more sincere) those Puritanes I say are here strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted. For if al must aske forgiuenes of sin, then all haue sinne. So are the Novatians also, who denied hope of mercy to such as fell after Baptisme to notorious sins. But if there had bin no hope of remissiō, Christ wold not haue taught such to say, <hi>Forgiue vs our trespasses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly we are here taught, howe this our<note place="margin">Howe sin is takē awaie:</note> transgression is taken away, namely by <hi>forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</hi> And seeing hee who is our heauenly prophet, teacheth vs, that by this meanes, wee must bee cleared and freed from sin: Let vs learne of him; for he is our only Master; and beleeue him, for he is the truth; and receiue his doctrine, for if there<note place="margin">Math: 23: 8: Ios: 14: 6:</note>

Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew and Saint Luke differ somwhat in words, in this petition, though not in the matter. For Saint Matthew willeth vs to aske forgiuenesse of our <hi>debts.</hi> The selfe same word in the Sirian tongue, (which it is thought our Sauior Christ did speake) signifieth both <hi>Debt,</hi> and also <hi>Sinne.</hi> And therefore whereas after Saint Matthewe we pray, <hi>forgiue vs our debtes,</hi> after Saint Luke we say, <hi>forgiue vs our trespasses,</hi> expressing that in plaine tearmes, which the other, by a very apt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue speech, did signifie. For man was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<note place="margin">Sin a debt:</note> waies bound vnto God, to yeeld vnto him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sincere obedience. First because <hi>Hee hath made vs, and not we our selues.</hi> Then also wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge<note place="margin">Psal: 100: 3:</note> him to be our Lorde, we must then serue him; our Father, we ought then to honour him. Hauing thus so many waies right ouer vs, and an interest in vs, looke what hee commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, we ought to obey. But we haue forfeited our recognisance; we haue not performed coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and paide our debt, but are by sin brought further behinde hand with him, then euer we can be able to satisfie for. For we are euen that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tressed
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:176702:96"/> seruāt, that <hi>had nothing to pay</hi> a very great summe, neither could we euer haue satisfied the<note place="margin">Mat. 18: 25:</note> same, but it pleased that king our Master, to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs all the debt.</hi> We are that man that fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theeues, and was robbed of all that hee had, in so much as his rayment was taken from<note place="margin">Luk: 10: 30:</note> him; and was also wounded, and so left not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to helpe himselfe. For our goodly and gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous garment, of holy obedience, by the force of sinne is taken from vs, and wee are now clad, with the filthy rags of our own corruption. And that worse is, wee are so weakened by the woundes of our transgression, that we as halfe dead, are no way able to helpe our selues. Wee must therefore pray, that the most mercifull Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritane, euen Christ our Sauiour, will power into this our wounde, the wine of comfort, and oile of compassion, that hee I say would heale vs with this sweete salue, <hi>Thy sinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>

               <hi>thee.</hi> For otherwise wee shall not finde our selues onlie <hi>halfe deade,</hi> as the Church of Rome, straining this parable somewhat further then they shoulde, doth erroneously gather; but euen <hi>wholy or quite dead,</hi> as our Sauiour Christ teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, purposely declaring what our estate is; and<note place="margin">Ios. 5. 25:</note> the apostle in sundry places, yea <hi>rotten</hi> in our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.<note place="margin">Eph: 2: 1: Col: 2: 13:</note>

               <hi>is forgiven, and whose sinne is covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquitie.</hi> Our Sauior Christ maketh vs in this, like to a poore man, that is bound in obligation, or set in a debt booke, for a summe which hee knoweth not howe to pay, and yet if he cannot satisfie it, hee must die in prison. Oh how ioyfull will that poore man be, if he be put in hope, that vpon his suit the debt will be pardoned, the bill canceled, or the booke crossed? Euen so doth our Sauiour Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort hereby the distressed conscience, whom hee teacheth to say, <hi>Forgiue vs our trespasses.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our conscience tell vs, that wee cannot make payment; yet Christ hereby assureth vs, that there is greate hope of pardon &amp; forgiuenes. And because he teacheth vs to say <hi>Forgiue vs our trespasses,</hi> we are infallibly to gather, that we cā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue our <hi>quietus est,</hi> vntill our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is our creditour, forgiue the debt: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we be eased of the burden, or freed from the guilt of sinne, but by him that calleth all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:176702:97"/> him that are <hi>weary and laden,</hi> promising that he<note place="margin">Math: 11: 28</note> will ease them.</p>
            <p>But what are these sinnes that we aske for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of? If we beleeue the very pillers of the church of Rome, they will tell vs that <hi>veniall</hi> sinnes, may many waies be taken away, so that if wee doe not aske forgiuenesse, yet by any work of charity they are so purged, that they cannot be punished eternally. Therefore though among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedies for such small staines, the saying of the <hi>Pater noster,</hi> say they is one, that will quite take it out, or wipe it away: yet because there are many other helpes (as before I said) they thinke it not very needfull that we should aske forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes thereof. Or if it so fall out that they say <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte nobis debita nostra,</hi> (for to speake in the tongue wee knowe, it hath beene thought hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and worthy extreame punishment) yet their meaning is not thereby to craue humbly pardon<note place="margin">Papists for veniall sins thinke not that they are behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Christ:</note> and forgiues as here wee are taught: but euen by speaking these very words, to merite the taking away of the venial sin. For they wil haue al their works <hi>sati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As for <hi>Mortall</hi> sinnes they are heauier, then that they can so easilie bee remoued (so they teach vs) as by asking forgiuenes. And therefore to be cleansed from them, they will haue vs to do other
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:176702:98"/> great workes, to merite and deserue or make recompence for the same. And the Popes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons are a good remedy for them, a good salue for that sore, or els they haue maruelously decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the worlde these many yeares, in promising pardon of sins without exception, to such as had their indulgences. But howsoeuer they haue borne the worlde in hande, that wee must (our sinnes beeing once in baptisme remitted) make satisfaction by our works, for the transgressions of the law, whereby wee after baptisme offende: yet it is most certaine, that the least sinnes that wee can commit, because they hinder that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection<note place="margin">Forgiuenes for all sins.</note> which the lawe requireth, are therfore no waie but by pardon abolished. And the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test offences because they are as fowle spots in a white garmente, can no way bee washed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye but by forgiuenesse: so that for all our sinnes of what waight or qualitie so euer they bee, against God, against man, in worde, thought, or deede, of commission, or of omission; wee must learne of Christ to say, <hi>Forgiue vs our trespasses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if any man aske, why wee shoulde daily craue this forgiuenesse, or oftener as Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite<note place="margin">Why this praier must still be said:</note> shall mooue vs, seeing that in baptisme there is full remission of all our sinnes, past, present, or to come. I answere that in this praier, wee
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:176702:98"/> craue at the handes of our most mercifull Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that wee who cannot if wee bee not too carelesse, but feele the waight and burden of our sinnes which still presseth vs down, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the filthinesse of them, in the sighte of God, may comfortably feele and finde, within our own consciences, that forgiuenesse and pardon of our transgressions, which God in his worde, hath promised, and in baptisme sealeth vp vnto vs. So that hereby wee shewe a continuall care and longing, that that Sacramente and the grace thereby assured vnto vs, may effectually comfort our mourning mindes, and raise vp our feeble harts, weakened and grieued with the wound of sinne.</p>
            <p>Moreouer because our Sauiour Christ teach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth vs to say, <hi>Forgiue vs our trespasses,</hi> he aduiseth<note place="margin">Our selues thus must pray</note> vs to be carefull while here we liue and walke in that waye, wherein are stumbling blockes, and stones to stumble at on euerie side; and we our selues so weake that wee are not able to goe vprightelie in the perfecte waie: that wee may sue for our owne peace, and make our owne requestes, that hee against whome onlye wee haue chiefelye offended in breaking of his lawe and commaundements, will pardon and forgiue vs. But if wee will leaue this to bee done by our atturnies, and to be dispatched by our delegates,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:176702:99"/> we haue no warrant for that in Gods booke; and therfore shall finde no comfort therof, in the time of death, nor fruit of it afterwardes.</p>
            <p>Lastly the forgiuing of this debte importeth<note place="margin">Full forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</note> as much, as the acquiting vs of the fault, and of the punishment. For who can say the debt is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, if the debter be cast in prison, or otherwise punishod for not paying it? Even so in this debte that we owe to God, because our saviour Christ instructeth vs, that wee must aske forgiuenes of it, wee may haue an assured considence, that not the fault onely, but also all the effectes of Gods displeasure, due to vs for the same, are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Otherwise (which God forbid that any Christian should once think) God were not a iust God, if he should punish without cause. And what cause can there be of punishment, when there is no offence? Or in what equity can the faulte bee laide against vs, which is pardoned. Therefore against that Popish Paradox of <hi>halfe forgiuenes,</hi> (who will not in any wise, that the <hi>punishment</hi> should be forgiven, but the <hi>fault</hi> onely) let vs hold fast this most comfortable doctrine, that hee that saide to him that was sicke of the palsie <hi>Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee,</hi> saide also, <hi>arise</hi>

And then as the prophet David saith, they are<note place="margin">Psalm: 32▪</note>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:176702:101"/> happy whose sinnes are forgiven: so on the contra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry where forgiuenesse of sins is not, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a portion with the devill and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, in vtter darkenesse, weeping and wailing &amp; gnashing of teeth. Therefore when we will pray to our good God, let vs first striue to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of our power, to sweepe out of every corner of our heartes, the filth of malice; and indevour not to forgiue onely, but also as much as in vs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to forget, whatsoever wronges any man, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by word or deede hath offered vnto vs: that hauing this testimony of a good conscience, that we as hartely as wee can doe, pardon all faultes committed against vs, we may with the greater assurance of the same holy spirite, which hath wrought this good in vs, say to our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Forgiue vs our trespasses, as vve forgiue them that trespasse against vs.</hi>

Not so. For in every such sin there is an offence against God, which we cannot medle withall. For what haue we to do, to take Gods office vpō vs? There is also a wronge done vnto man.

            <pb n="187" facs="tcp:176702:101"/>
            <p>Neither yet must we imagine that al wrongs or evil dealings must be suffered amongest men, because it becommeth Christians to be ready to forgiue.

For hee desireth not that the wicked should die. These two things be cause they are confessed of all, neede no further proofe.

That fruit spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, from the roote of bitternes that is in vs. And we so readilye, nay so greedily, yeelde vnto the prouocations of sinne, that we need no forcing at all therto.

               <hi>Exhort one another daily while it is called to day, lest any of you be hardened, through the deceitfulnesse of sinne.</hi> For sinne is like a cup, well mingled with sugar and delectable spices aboue, but with poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, in the bottome. At the first it hath delighte &amp; pleasure, but in the end, bitternes &amp; death. Thus
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:176702:104"/> then it appeareth, that sinne commeth not from God, but from our selues, yea and that with too much readines.</p>
            <p>How then is God said to harden the hearte, to lead into tentation, to giue vp, or deliuer into noisome lusts, or a reprobate sence? Or how doth hee make men to erre? For as I haue shewed before, all these thinges are affirmed of him. Hee first withdraweth his holye spirite from<note place="margin">God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth his spirit:</note> those whome hee is saide to harden, and by that meanes are they become harde and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to anye good worke, hauing that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing founetaine of heauenlie graces stopped from them, whereby onlie they can be softened. For as GOD may bee truelye saide to harden the earth, as also hee doth threaten by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet<note place="margin">Levi: 26. 19:</note> Moses, that hee will make the <hi>earth hard as brasse,</hi> for the wickednesse of the people, not because hee putteth anye hardnesse into it, but because in withholding the droppes of heauen, and the raine from aboue, it is become dry▪ and vnfruitefull: so hee hardeneth vs, when he softe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs not.</p>
            <p>Then likewise hee doth more then suffer men to be solicited by such motions, &amp; allured by such occasions, as through their fault draw thē to sin,<note place="margin">Occasions of sinne.</note> and turne in the godly to their bettering, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to walk more warily before the Lord:

David was allured to sinne by the sight of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba. That Bethsheba did bathe her selfe, and that David did at that time▪ rise out of his bed, and walke on the roofe of his Pallace, these acti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons, which were the occasion of his sinnes, were governed and directed by God. It was no doubt Gods worke also, that the Damosel did charge Peter to haue beene one of them that followed<note place="margin">Mat: 26: 69:</note> Christ, which was vnto him an occasion, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare and curse himselfe in the deniall thereof. He that governeth the sparowes in their falling to the earth, and ordereth the lottes, did also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them in these actions. What then? did God cause David to lust, or Peter to denie his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster? No hee made David to see Bethsheba, and Peter to heare what the Damosel saide: but the one had his owne lust kindled by the sight of his eie, the other his faith sore shakē, by hearing that question of the maide: and they both were decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their owne corruption, and drawen to sin by their owne fault.</p>
            <p>But God hath in these things no sinfull affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,<note place="margin">Psa: 145▪ 17 The ende why God doth this:</note> hee is holy in al his workes. And as a wise

But against the wicked, by such meanes hee exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth his iust iudgments, punishing in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> sin by sinne. And this is it that the Apostle Saint Paule teacheth the Thessalonians. <hi>Because</hi>
               <note place="margin">2: Thes: 2▪ 10</note> (saith hee) <hi>they received not the loue of the truth, that they might be saved: therefore God shall sende them stronge delusion that they shoulde beleeve lies, that all they might be damned which beleeue not the truth, but had pleasure in vnrighteousnes.</hi> And thus do we yeeld vnto our great God soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and dominion, in acknowledging his power and working in all things. And thus we giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">2.

            <p>Nowe out of this which hitherto hath beene<note place="margin">God author of the fact not of the sinne:</note> saide, we learne first that God in all that we doe hat evill is, is author of the facte, but not of the faulte; of the worke, but not of the wickednesse that is therein. So that wee must in every such action, bee wise to put a difference, betwixt that which is Gods part therin; &amp; that which our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:176702:107"/> nature polluteth: as in manythings there is to bee seene a manifest discrepaunce betweene a thing it selfe, and the imperfection that is in the same. A workeman cutteth with an axe or edge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toole that is broken or rough. The workeman is cause of the cutting, but not of the roughnes or vneuen cutting. The schoole-master maketh his scholler that stammereth to say his lesson, and he in saying stutteth or stammereth. The Master is the cause of his speaking, as iustly he may (for he hath authority ouer him) but the stammering, is of some imperfection in his speech. Or the Master commandeth his servant that halteth, to goe to doe such businesse as he hath for him to do: he is now the cause of his seruauntes going, but not of his halting; that is of himselfe. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise God in all our workes, worketh in vs, or with vs, so farre as there is no corruption in the same: but the sin that we commit, is wholy ours,<note place="margin">Eccl: 15: 11: 12. 20:</note> and not his, as of the son of Sirach we may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learne.</p>
            <p>Secondly that whatsoeuer he worketh in vs,<note place="margin">God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to a good ende</note> he doth it alwaies to a good end, and with a good affection: either mercifully dealing with his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their amendment; or iustly executing his iudgementes against the impenitent; and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies setting foorth his glorie, both in the one, &amp; by the other. So that if wee rightly examine his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:176702:107"/> ings, wee shall be so far frō making him the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of sinne, that wee may rather plainely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, as truely wee may, with the Apostle Saint Paule, that God shall be iustified in his wordes,<note place="margin">Rom: 3: 5▪</note> (yea and in his workes also) and ouercome when he is iu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ged. And thus much of this questiō, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God be the authour of sin, which God forbid we should once surmise.</p>
            <p>But for these wordes of this petition, there is not in my iudgement any great hardnes therin. For we pray, that God woulde not deale with vs according to our deseruing, neither rewarde vs according to our wickednesse, but that he would strengthen our weaknes, correct our cowardise, reforme our infirmities, and supply al our wāts: not giuing vs ouer to our owne lusts; but watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouer vs with a vigilant eie, that wee fall not into such wicked lustes, as our owne corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is prone vnto. But because of this request there are sundry branches, it is not vnprofitable to speake of the particular thinges contained in this praier.</p>
            <p>First therefore we craue of God, that seeing our weakenes is such, as that wee haue alwaies iust cause to mistrust our owne strength; God will in such sort deale with vs, that wee bee not<note place="margin">Wee pray not to bee tempted to evill▪</note> tempted. That is, that no occasion bee offered vnto vs, whereby wee may bee mooued to euill.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:176702:108"/> For our nature is like to a water, which so long as it is not stirred or troubled seemeth cleare: But if a sticke, or anie other thing, bee it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so cleane, bee thrust into the same, the filth and mudde ariseth, and sheweth it selfe: euen so wee, vpon euerie occasion doe shewe our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and our wicked affections vpon euery lighte motion, are most readye to burst foorth. Wee therefore knowing our pronenesse to sinne, and our weakenesse to withstande such assaults, first desire that wee bee not tempted or solicited to euill.</p>
            <p>Then also that if God see it to bee fit, either for his glorie, or our good, that wee shoulde so bee tryed: wee craue that God in this our tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, will not withdrawe from vs his helping hande, leauing vs to our selues, and our owne<note place="margin">We pray for Gods helpe.▪</note> concupiscence. Because wee knowe that we are not then able to withstande the verye leaste assaulte, one minute of an howre, but that readilye wee yeelde, and are leade awaye cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues.</p>
            <p>And thirdelye wee aske, that hee will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist<note place="margin">Assistāce of Gods grace</note> vs by his grace. Because it is not enough if hee doeth but looke on. Therefore wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of our heauenlie Father, that <hi>hee vvill not</hi>

            <p>Lastly, in consideration of our sinnes which haue deserued, that God shoulde in most seuere manner deale with vs: wee beseech GOD, not to punish our former wickednesse, with the<note place="margin">Not to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

And because in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity chiefly, not to profit is to goe backe: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee also send vp our groanes vnto our good

            <p>Now after these petitions in some sort expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, remaineth the addition or conclusion of the Lords praier: <hi>For thine is the kingdome, the power, and the glorie for ever, and ever, amen.</hi> Which wordes although they are omitted by S. Luke, yet are they worthy to be thought vpon, not only because they are written by Saint Matthe we, but also because they contain pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fitable doctrine. And whereas there are two things necessary for vs to be perswaded of, in all the praiers that wee make, either to God or man, if we will pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, and with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pe that wee shall bee heard: that is an assuraunce of Gods loue, and a knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his might: in the preface of this praier, Christ hath taught the former, when hee assureth vs that his loue towardes vs is such, as that wee may without doubting cal him Father: and now in the knit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing vp of the same, he calleth vs to the consideration of his power: that wee with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:176702:112"/> may cal vpon such a God, as both will heare vs, because he loueth vs, and can helpe vs, because all power belongeth vnto him.</p>
            <p>And first when wee acknowledge that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome<note place="margin">God aboue all kinges:</note> to bee his, wee are taught not to haue our eies dazeled with the externall glory of these worldly Princes or Potentates, whose breath is in their nostrels, <hi>it departeth, they returne to their</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 146: 4.</note>
               <hi>earth, and then their thoughtes perish:</hi> but to fixe our hart and hope vpon him, to whome of right all kingdome and dominion belongeth: and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of whome, the mightiest Monarches and most puissant Princes that rule vpon the earth, are but petty magistrates, that owe vnto him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and homage. For when wee confesse that kingdome is belonging to him, it is as much as if wee had saide, that the kinges that wee see to rule and raigne vpon the face of the earth, are his lievetenants, set in their roomes by him, and by him to be deposed as he shall see it fit. They are to obey his commaundementes, and to governe as he prescribeth; or else that great king whose righte to raigne wee doe heere confesse, shall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish thē for abusing their authority. Soveraigne and absolute kinges they are not, howsoever they come to their roial estate, but his subiectes and servants. For whatsoever may be said to be king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome, we say heere that it is his.</p>
            <pb n="210" facs="tcp:176702:113"/>
            <p>Secondly wee ascribe vnto him power. So that as in the former title, we confesse that he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Power to subdue his foes or helpe his servauntes</note> hath right to rule and governe: so heere wee graunt that he hath ability and means to dispose of all thinges at his pleasure. Earthly kings and princes be they never so mighty, and haue they never so good right to raigne over their subiects yet cannot alwaies either subdue their rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous traitours that rise vp against them; or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out these ambitious neighbours, that seeke to encroach vppon their Dominions. But this our king, as he may claime as his owne all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the earth, yea the rule of heaven and earth, and of all his creatures: so because power is his, that is, belongeth vnto him, and to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therfore hath hee such might, that none can withdraw their neckes from the yoake of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Neither Pharaoh the mighty, nor Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>buchad-nezer the proude, nor Iulian the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata (who confessed himselfe to bee to weake to deale with this mighty and powerfull king) were able to withstande him. For hee hath not onely the Angelles, his ministering spirites, to woorke his will; but men also at his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, to execute his iust wrath; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against their enemies, and such as they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but even against their friendes and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as did the Midianites in the daies of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:176702:113"/> Hee (such is his power) can cast downe<note place="margin">Iudg: 7: 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

Hee can cause<note place="margin">Ios: 10: 11:</note> them to heare a noise of chariots, and horses, and a greate army, as hee did for Samaria a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nst<note place="margin">2: King: 7: 6</note> the Syrians, so that they fled for feare. Yea what thinge is there so weake or base, that<note place="margin">He maketh weake meanes stronge</note> hee cannot make stronge or valiant, to woorke his will. The frogges, flies, lice, yea the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes or dust vnder our feete, are meane crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and contemtible. But God by them made the stubborne and harde hearte of Pharaoh to yeelde. Worthely therefore wee yeelde vnto him the power and might, who because he <hi>doth but speake the vvoord,</hi> and thinges are effected, therefore doth even what himselfe willeth. So that we iustly may say as Christ hath taught vs, <hi>thine is power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly we ascribe vnto him glorie, that is, honour, laude, and praise. Because hee wisely governeth the whole worlde, and mightely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth of all thinges, as it seemeth good to him: wee doe therefore confesse most willingly, <hi>that</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal: 115: 1:</note>
               <hi>not vnto vs, but to his name the praise must bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> The summe therefore of this conclusion is, that GOD rightfullie may, and mighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie doth, dispose of all thinges; and therfore
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:176702:114"/> that the glory of all our actions belongeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and no other.</p>
            <p>And we must marke this word <hi>for,</hi> which shew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth that the wordes following are a reason of that which went before. Wee seeme therefore in the shutting vp of this praier, to declare what<note place="margin">The cause of our bold<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> it is that hath imboldened vs to call vppon him. Euen this, because kingdome is his, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e be done, but at his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente. Power is his, and therefore wee can haue no helpe, but from him. Glory is his, and therefore cannot bee yeelded to our selues, for anye our doinges, or to anye other creatures whatsoeuer. Heere therefore wee learne a most necessarie lesson, which the LORDE GOD for his greate mercies sake, imprinte in the heartes of them that call vppon the name of the LORDE, that they maye learne to departe from that greate iniquitie, wherewith the world hath beene, and yet is, most daungerously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. For wee haue in our necessities, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse or daunger, vowed our vowes vnto them that were no Gods, that if they woulde deliuer vs, wee woulde bee thankefull for it, and offer some token of thankefulnesse vnto them. Wee haue prayed vnto them, as if they coulde helpe vs. Wee haue vowed our selues before them, as if they had beene Gods. Wee haue put in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:176702:114"/> them too much trust and confidence, as if they had beene able to doe vs good. Yea, before stockes and stones, the worke of some carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Mason, with the helpe of a Painter, wee haue saide euen before the Images of men or women, without regarde of what sexe or sorte they are, <hi>Our father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here our Sauiour CHRIST in these wordes teacheth vs, that we cannot confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye call vpon anye for helpe or succour, but onlie vppon him to whome kingdome, power, and glorie belongeth, that is vpon God only. Let them then that doe please themselues so well, in their inuocation of Saintes or other creatures, bring foorth and set before vs anye creature in heauen and earth, anye Angell or Archangell, any Sainte departed man or woman, that can truelie challenge to themselues kingdome, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and glorye; then maye they with the better assuraunce call vpon such, if also they haue anie warraunte out of the woorde of GOD, that such will haue a Father-like loue and care ouer them. But <hi>kingdome, povver, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye belonge to GOD onlie,</hi> and therefore our prayers also, cannot well and Christianlike be made or directed to any other. And thus much for the instruction or lesson that heere we haue to learne.</p>
            <pb n="214" facs="tcp:176702:115"/>
            <p>We haue also out of this comforte or consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that we▪ who in the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ginning assured our selues of his Fatherly loue towards vs, doe now also know his power and might that hee hath to doe vs good. So that as we may rightly and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswade our selues, that hee will helpe vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath a Fatherly affection vnto vs: so we may assure our selues likewise, that he can do vs any good, that wee stande in neede of, because that all kingdome, power, and glory is his, and therefore all things are at his commandemente. And thus much as it pleased God to directe my pen, haue I thought good to set down, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of that, which wee commonly call the Lordes praier.</p>
            <p>Now I beseech thee (O Christian Reader) to consider well with thy selfe, how necessarie an exercise praier is for vs, who heere as Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes and straungers▪ doe trauell in this vale of misery, where wee finde manie wantes, fall into many daungers, are swallowed vp of many griefes, and compassed about on euery side, with many lustes, that fight against our soule. In all which calamities, wee haue no supply, safety, cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or defence but in flying to our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, making our moan, &amp; vttering our cōplaints vnto him, and as it were shaddowing our selues, vnder the protection of his wings. Neither can
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:176702:115"/> wee doe this, but by humbling our selues before the throne of grace, by our feruent and faithfull praiers, crying not in words only, but in hearte especially, <hi>Our Father which art in heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because aboue all thinges Gods glory must be sought for; let vs as we are heere taught first and for most pray, that our good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God▪ will so direct our hearts, our mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#apex" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And let it not content vs when wee haue thus praied as in this praier we are taught: but let vs also examine without partialitie, whether wee haue according to the trust committed to vs, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely sanctified Gods name, inlarged his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and obeyed his will, according to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, power, learning, wisdome or wealth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon vs: that if we finde our selues shorte in any duty, prince or subiect, of high or lowe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, learned or vnlearned, we may know &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that to begge of God, that which our selues
